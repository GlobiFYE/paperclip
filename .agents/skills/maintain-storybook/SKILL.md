# Maintain Storybook

Read the [Storybook catalog contract](../../../maps/storybook-map/README.md),
the relevant [feature recipes](../../../maps/feature-map/README.md), and
[DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md). The feature map is an upstream input. This skill
owns stories, their fixtures/support, and `maps/storybook-map/`; it does not edit
the feature or agent-access maps. Report upstream drift to
`maintain-verification-skill` with source evidence.

## Reconcile the requested scope

For a feature/change, follow its capability IDs to catalog entries and shared
dependencies. For a full inventory, account for every configured story file,
including historical examples. Start with `node scripts/storybook-catalog.mjs`.
Record the source revision and whether the pass covers source, rendering,
interactions, or visual comparisons. Inventory completeness is not behavioral
coverage. Do not expand a targeted maintenance request into an all-product audit.

Compare each affected story's rendered subject, props, fixture responses, actions,
and assertions with the production implementation and recipe. Follow imported
wrappers: a production Button inside a locally recreated page does not make that
page a production-component story. A real production page using mocked APIs is
valid isolation; record component provenance and data simulation separately.
Inspect mock methods/paths, payload shapes, errors, identity, gates, and reset
behavior. An API method returning success without the relevant state transition
can hide drift. Do not replace errors with generic successful mocks to pass.

Prefer mounting the shipped subject and mocking its external boundary. Retain
local layout wrappers and fixture data when they serve that isolation. Replace a
duplicate product implementation only when the current component expresses the
same scenario without losing the original purpose. Production bugs and larger
redesigns are separate findings, not reasons to rewrite expected behavior.

Classify current examples, proposals, historical explorations, and unresolved
cases explicitly. Use `unreviewed` when evidence does not establish parity.
Retain useful superseded work with its rationale and replacement reference;
do not delete a story merely because it is old, mocked, or duplicated by name.
Record mixed suites honestly and split them only when that improves review.

## Preserve identity and keep the index useful

Assign existing stable `area/capability` references, with one primary reference
and optional related references. Foundations and unmapped proposals need explicit
reasons rather than invented capabilities. Cross-cutting stories have one source
and several references. Do not count historical/proposed stories as current
feature coverage.

For shared foundations that demonstrate a mapped capability, keep their existing
folder/sidebar with `home: "foundations"` and an exception reason, then add related
capability references. Inspect the named exports before linking them. Notes must
name the demonstrated states and remaining limits; an association does not certify
the whole capability. If a story reveals a shipped capability absent upstream,
reconcile its feature recipe and access companion through map maintenance first.

Preserve story exports and IDs. Before moves/title changes, capture the existing
built `index.json`; use explicit meta IDs when needed and compare IDs afterward.
Place stories under `ui/storybook/stories/<primary-feature-area>/`. Use the feature
map's section and feature names as their sidebar prefix; keep useful scenario
groupings beneath that prefix. Put shared fixture modules in `ui/storybook/support/`.
Keep the catalog's `stableId` equal to the explicit CSF meta ID even when the title
changes. Unmapped component examples belong under Foundations; the catalog guide
belongs under Overview. The checker verifies these conventions.

Keep the main guide and every feature Overview congruent with the upstream index:
same section/feature names and order, all capabilities in recipe order, related
suite links across primary homes, and explicit missing examples. Regenerate
`ui/storybook/generated/` and the preview config's inline `storySort.order` through
the catalog command; never hand-edit generated pages or ordering
or add generated guides to the authored catalog. Generated guides are not example
coverage. Preserve their `feature-map-<area>--overview` IDs. When an upstream area
is removed or renamed, inspect unexpected generated files and resolve them
explicitly; the generator will not silently delete them.

Keep review links and snapshot names working. Prefer classification/index fixes
before bulk directory moves. Record every directly rendered production subject in
the catalog's review sources, including relative imports and primitives when they
are the demonstrated subject. Do not cap the number of source references.
Update review fingerprints only after inspecting the changed source; do not refresh hashes merely
to silence drift checks.

Update the catalog. Keep [verification routes](../../../maps/storybook-map/VERIFICATION.md)
aligned with the unassociated capability IDs: distinguish missing shipped UI
examples from CLI/operator operations and real browser checks. Record source
revision, concrete reasons, production contracts and existing test starting points;
test presence is not passing evidence. Do not exempt a mixed UI/API capability
wholesale. When associating a new example, update this gap inventory without
discarding its separate production verification obligations.

Run `node scripts/storybook-catalog.mjs --write` to refresh
its generated indexes and feature pages, then run the checker without flags and
`node --test scripts/storybook-catalog.test.mjs scripts/storybook-feature-index.test.mjs`.
The script validates
inventory/references/review fingerprints, not semantic parity or runtime health.
Use `review-storybook` for affected rendering and interactions. Reuse the existing
Storybook/Playwright tools; add no separate launcher, runtime, or baseline system.
Do not accept new screenshot baselines as part of a catalog cleanup.

Report what was corrected, retained, and still needs review, naming exact files
and capabilities. Keep source-only results separate from executed results and
name blocked checks. A full pass must not hide unreviewed stories or claim that
fixture interactions establish production API, permission, or provider behavior.
